# HR Resume Screening System — Windows + VS Code Setup

This is a **fully implemented, working system with a menu-driven console
interface** — not a stub, not an auto-run script. All 17 modules contain
real logic, and `main.c` now drives everything through interactive menus:

```
HR Resume Screening System
 1. Login
 2. Signup
 3. Exit
```

After logging in, you get the full HR menu:

```
 1. Upload Job Requirement       6. Search Candidates
 2. Bulk Upload Resumes          7. Generate Reports
 3. Process Uploaded Resumes     8. View Analytics Dashboard
 4. View Candidate Ranking       9. Change Password
 5. Shortlist Top Candidates    10. Logout      0. Exit Program
```

Every option maps to real module functions: upload a `.pdf`/`.txt`
requirement (default `data/job_requirement.pdf`), bulk-upload a folder of
resumes (default `data/resumes`, PDF and TXT mixed), process them (parses →
tokenizes → analyzes → extracts info → matches skills → scores), then rank,
shortlist, search, export CSV/TXT reports, and view the dashboard — all from
the menu, on data you choose at runtime.

It's been compiled and test-driven end-to-end here (zero warnings under
`-Wpedantic`) with simulated input covering every menu option, including a
real uploaded PDF resume and a real PDF requirements table.

## One extra dependency: Poppler (for PDF uploads)

Both bulk resume PDFs and requirement PDFs are converted to text using the
`pdftotext` command-line tool (part of Poppler). Plain C has no PDF parser of
its own, so the program shells out to it.

1. Download Poppler for Windows: https://github.com/oschwartz10612/poppler-windows/releases
   (grab the latest `Release-XX.XX.X-0.zip`)
2. Unzip it somewhere, e.g. `C:\poppler`
3. Add `C:\poppler\Library\bin` (the folder containing `pdftotext.exe`) to your
   PATH the same way you added the MinGW folder in step 1.4 below
4. Verify: open a **new** terminal and run `pdftotext -v`

If `pdftotext` isn't found, the program still runs — it just skips PDFs and
tells you to convert them manually or upload `.txt` instead.

## 1. Install a C compiler (MinGW-w64)

VS Code doesn't compile C by itself — you need `gcc` and `gdb` on your machine.

1. Go to https://www.msys2.org/ and download/run the installer.
2. Open the **MSYS2 UCRT64** terminal that opens after install, and run:
   ```
   pacman -Syu
   ```
   (it will close the window — reopen MSYS2 UCRT64 and run it again if prompted)
3. Install the toolchain:
   ```
   pacman -S mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-gcc mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-gdb make
   ```
4. Add the compiler to your Windows PATH:
   - Search **"Environment Variables"** in the Start menu → **Edit the system environment variables** → **Environment Variables**
   - Under **User variables**, select `Path` → **Edit** → **New**
   - Add: `C:\msys64\ucrt64\bin`
   - Click OK on all dialogs.
5. Verify it worked — open a **new** Command Prompt (important: must be new) and run:
   ```
   gcc --version
   gdb --version
   ```
   Both should print version info. If "not recognized", the PATH step didn't take — re-check step 4 and restart your terminal/VS Code.

## 2. Install VS Code + extension

1. Install VS Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/
2. Open VS Code → Extensions (`Ctrl+Shift+X`) → install **C/C++** (by Microsoft).

## 3. Open the project

1. Unzip this project folder anywhere, e.g. `C:\Projects\HR_Resume_Screening_System`.
2. In VS Code: **File → Open Folder…** → select that folder.
3. Open `.vscode/c_cpp_properties.json` and fix `compilerPath` to match where your
   `gcc.exe` actually lives (find it with `where gcc` in Command Prompt — commonly
   `C:\msys64\ucrt64\bin\gcc.exe` or `C:\msys64\mingw64\bin\gcc.exe`).

## 4. Build it

**Option A — VS Code task (recommended)**
Press `Ctrl+Shift+B`. This runs the pre-configured build task and produces
`hr_resume_screener.exe` in the project root.

**Option B — Terminal**
Open a terminal in VS Code (`` Ctrl+` ``) and run:
```
gcc -Wall -Wextra -g -Iinclude src\auth.c src\job_requirement.c src\resume_upload.c src\resume_processing.c src\tokenizer.c src\stopwords.c src\analyzer.c src\keyword_category.c src\info_extractor.c src\skill_match.c src\scoring.c src\ranking.c src\shortlist.c src\search.c src\report.c src\dashboard.c src\utils.c src\globals.c main.c -o hr_resume_screener.exe
```
(Files are listed explicitly rather than using `src\*.c` — PowerShell, VS Code's
default terminal, doesn't expand that wildcard the way `cmd.exe` does, and
passes it to `gcc` literally, causing an "Invalid argument" error.)

**Option C — Makefile (if you installed `make` in step 1.3)**
```
mingw32-make
```
or, if you installed plain `make` via MSYS2:
```
make
```

## 5. Run it

```
.\hr_resume_screener.exe
```

You'll land on the main menu. A typical first run:
1. **Login** with `hr_admin` / `password123` (auto-created on first run)
2. **1** - Upload Job Requirement → press Enter to accept the default PDF
3. **2** - Bulk Upload Resumes → press Enter to accept the default folder
4. **3** - Process Uploaded Resumes → runs the full pipeline on everything found
5. **4** - View Candidate Ranking, **5** - Shortlist, **6** - Search, **7** - Reports, **8** - Dashboard
6. **10** - Logout, or **0** - Exit

Reports land in `output/reports/` (`Candidate_Report.csv`, `Candidate_Report.txt`,
`Full_Report.txt`) and the shortlist in `output/shortlisted/`.

Drop your own resumes (PDF or TXT) into `data/resumes/` (or type a different
folder path at the prompt) and your own requirement file anywhere (PDF or
TXT) — the menu re-reads whatever path you give it, no recompiling needed.

## 6. Debug it

Set a breakpoint (click left of a line number in any `.c` file), then press `F5`.
This uses `.vscode/launch.json`, which builds first and attaches `gdb`.

## Project layout

```
HR_Resume_Screening_System/
├── main.c              # Drives the full pipeline, calls every module in order
├── Makefile             # Alternative to the VS Code task
├── include/*.h          # One header per module (function declarations)
├── src/*.c              # One source file per module (currently stub bodies)
├── data/                # job_requirement.txt, stopwords.txt, skills.txt, categories.txt, resumes/
├── output/               # analysis/, reports/, shortlisted/, logs/ (created empty, your code writes here)
└── docs/                 # put your SRS / UML / project report PDFs here
```

## How it all fits together

- `include/common.h` / `src/globals.c` — shared `Candidate` struct and all
  global arrays (candidates, job skills, technical skills, stopwords,
  categories, keyword-frequency table). Every module works against this
  shared state, keyed on `CURRENT` (a macro for "the candidate being processed
  right now").
- `main.c` → `ProcessResume()` drives one resume through the entire pipeline:
  read → extract info → clean/tokenize → remove stopwords → frequency count →
  top keywords → categorize → detect domain → stats → match skills → score.
- After all resumes are processed: `RankCandidates()` sorts by final score,
  `SelectTopCandidates()` / `GenerateShortlist()` pick the winners, then
  reports and the dashboard summarize everything.

## Tuning it for your own use

- **Job requirement**: edit `data/job_requirement.txt` (one skill per line).
- **Known technical skills** (what counts as a "skill" at all): `data/skills.txt`.
- **Stopwords**: `data/stopwords.txt`.
- **Skill categories** (used for categorization + domain detection):
  `data/categories.txt` — blocks separated by a blank line, first line is the
  category name, following lines are skills in it.
- **Scoring weights**: `src/scoring.c` (currently Skill 50 + Projects 20 +
  Experience 15 + Education 10 + Certifications 5 = 100).
- **How many candidates get shortlisted**: `SelectTopCandidates(2)` in `main.c`.

## Known limitations of the extraction heuristics

Info extraction (name/email/phone/degree/experience/projects/certifications)
uses pattern heuristics, not real NLP — it works well on typical resume
layouts but isn't perfect on every format:
- **Experience years**: only recognized when the resume states it explicitly
  (e.g. "3 years experience"). Resumes that only list date ranges for each
  job (e.g. "Nov 2023 – Dec 2023") won't have years auto-computed.
- **Section boundaries** (Projects/Certifications): detected by treating
  short ALL-CAPS lines as new section headers, and skipping lines that start
  with `-`/`*` as bullet descriptions rather than titles. Unusual resume
  formatting can occasionally mis-split sections.
- **Skill matching**: phrase-aware (handles "Node.js", "Linked List", etc.
  correctly, and won't false-positive "Java" inside "JavaScript"), but only
  recognizes skills listed in `data/skills.txt` — add any skill you care
  about there.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---|---|
| `gcc: command not found` / not recognized | PATH not set correctly — redo step 1.4, open a **new** terminal |
| VS Code doesn't recognize `#include` / red squiggles everywhere | Fix `compilerPath` in `.vscode/c_cpp_properties.json` |
| `Ctrl+Shift+B` says "no build task" | Make sure you opened the **folder** (not just a file) in VS Code |
| `undefined reference to 'WinMain'` | You compiled without `main.c`, or `main.c`'s `main()` got renamed/removed |
